Functions that require rewriting:
 - qGetQ
 - qGetR
 - gmat2euler
 - q_average_orientations (too slow, is redundant)
 - q_min_distfun (to generalize the way symmetry is handled)
 - Grain.get_neighbors (can be simplified/sped up, maybe using MATLAB functions available)
 - Reconstructor.find_triplets (eliminate miso requirement to simplify, handle similar orientations in filtering step?)

 Terms to define in documentation:
 - triplet
 - trio
 - variant
 - OR
 - cluster
 - PA
 
 
 Programming concepts to include/rework:
 - Re-centering of cluster PA orientations after growth function
 - object get/set functions
 - make OR an object to be passed around, instead of a case. This way, custom ORs can be used
 - Generalize the way symmetry is handled? Include a phase library that has a phasename/symmetry type table that can be consulted for symmetry operators to be used when generating symmetries and PA/daughters
 - Include a "gen_syms" function instead of reading in symmetry operators for a given symmetry
 - The "daughterCluster" member "parentPhaseOrientations" should be renamed
 - Include a "resplit" function to re-attempt the division of two overlapping regions
 
 
 
List of temporary fixes:
-Input options for reconstructor object are manually set in constructor method
-code to find stepsize from grain files
-Code to filter clusters simply removes clusters representing other possible PA orientations for a given region
-Code to fill clusters includes grains of phases nont included in reconstruction
-daughterGIDmat member of reconstructor contains all
